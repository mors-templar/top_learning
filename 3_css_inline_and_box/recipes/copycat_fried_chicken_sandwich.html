            <p><strong>Copycat Fried Chicken Sandwich</strong> are made by coating chicken breasts in a seasoned flour mixture, frying until golden and crispy, then tossing the chicken in spicy buffalo sauce for a perfect balance of heat and crunch. </p>
            <p>To make the sandwich, start by dredging chicken breasts in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika, then fry them in hot oil until they turn crispy and golden brown. Once cooked, coat the chicken thoroughly in a tangy and spicy buffalo sauce made from hot sauce and melted butter. Serve the crispy buffalo chicken on toasted sandwich buns with fresh lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and a drizzle of cooling ranch or blue cheese dressing for a delicious contrast to the fiery chicken.</p>

            <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)</li>
                <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li> 
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Combine flour, poultry seasoning, and pepper in a shallow dish or pie plate. Blend with a fork or whisk.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Dip chicken in the breading mixture until well and evenly coated on both sides. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
                <li>Add enough oil to a large skillet so that it thickly coats the bottom and heat over medium-high heat until sizzling but not smoking. Place 2 chicken fillets in the skillet so they fit comfortably; do not overcrowd. Fry until crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain chicken on paper towels and repeat twice, adding more oil as necessary, to fry remaining chicken. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from oven. Place a chicken fillet on the bottom half of a bun. Add Buffalo sauce to taste. Top with pickle slices, tomato, and lettuce. Spread ranch dressing on the inside of the top bun and place over the sandwich. Repeat to make remaining sandwiches.</li>
